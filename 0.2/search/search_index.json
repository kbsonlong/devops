Kubernetes manifests can be specified in several ways:</p> <ul> <li>kustomize applications</li> <li>helm charts</li> <li>jsonnet files</li> <li>Plain directory of YAML/json manifests</li> <li>Any custom config management tool configured as a config management plugin</li> </ul> <p>Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit. See tracking strategies for additional details about the different tracking strategies available.</p> <p>For a quick 10 minute overview of Argo CD, check out the demo presented to the Sig Apps community meeting:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":"<p>Argo CD is implemented as a kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares the current, live state against the desired target state (as specified in the Git repo).
